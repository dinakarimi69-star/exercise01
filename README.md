debugging exercise1
This exercise focuses on identifying and fixing a logical bug in a Python function that maps a numeric ID to a fruit name. The debugging process required understanding Python data structures and correcting incorrect assumptions about element ordering.
problem:
The method id_to_fruit() trys to return a fruit from the set based on its index (fruit_id). However, the function is returning incorrect results for the given indices. This is because sets in Python are unordered collections, which means there’s no predictable order for the elements inside a set and data structure is wrong. In Python, sets are unordered:
the returned results do not matched outputs:

Index 1 → "orange" 

Index 3 → "kiwi" 

Index 4 → "strawberry" 

Solution:

To fix this issue, we need to sort the set into a list before indexing it. Sorting guarantees a deterministic order and allows us to safely access fruits by their index.

EXERCISE2:

Problem:
The function is expected to return a new NumPy array where the x and y coordinates are flipped for every bounding box. However, the returned result is incorrect.
the original implementation contains:
coords[:, 0], coords[:, 1], coords[:, 2], coords[:, 3], = coords[:, 1], coords[:, 1], coords[:, 3], coords[:, 2]
this code has two problems:

coords[:, 1] is assigned twice, meaning column 0 and column 1 receive the same values.

The intended swap between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is not performed correctly.
